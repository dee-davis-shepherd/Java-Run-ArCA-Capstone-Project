# Java Run ArCA Capstone Project
RESTful web service created as a capstone project for  Arkansas Coding Academy's Java Full Stack Program. 
Java Run is a mockup coffee shop that uses a RESTFul web service ordering system with CRUD functionality. The back end utilizes Java 17, Apache Maven, and Spring Boot technologies while the front end utilizes Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular JS. Heidi SQL and MariaDB were used for the creation of the database. All unicorn images were generated using Microsoft Copilot AI. Images from the Menu page are licensed from iStock stock photos.

This project was a capstone project created to graduate from the Arkansas Coding Academy's 24-week Java Full Stack Bootcamp. All alterations after July 2024 to the code are due to continuous efforts to improve upon the original project.
